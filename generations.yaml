    description: "The original Chrysler 200 was essentially a heavily refreshed version of the Chrysler Sebring, representing Chrysler's attempt to improve its competitiveness in the mid-size segment following the company's restructuring under Fiat. Available as both a sedan and convertible (with soft or retractable hardtop), it featured significantly updated exterior styling with a more modern appearance. The interior saw major improvements in design and material quality compared to the Sebring. Powertrain options included a 2.4L four-cylinder or a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 283 HP, the latter providing class-competitive performance. The first-generation 200 was featured in Chrysler's notable 'Imported from Detroit' advertising campaign and represented a transitional model aimed at improving the brand's image while a completely new generation was developed."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2015
    end_year: 2017
    description: "The completely redesigned second-generation 200 represented a significant leap forward in design, technology, and refinement. Available only as a sedan (the convertible was discontinued), it featured sleek, coupe-like styling with a sloping roofline and distinctive front fascia. Built on an extended version of the Fiat Compact platform, it offered front-wheel drive as standard with an innovative available all-wheel drive system that could disconnect the rear axle when not needed for improved efficiency. Powertrain options continued with a 2.4L four-cylinder or 3.6L V6, the latter now paired with a segment-first nine-speed automatic transmission. The interior featured premium materials, especially in higher trims, and advanced technology including an 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreen system and electronic rotary gear selector. Despite critical acclaim for its design and features, the 200 faced challenges including limited rear seat headroom due to its stylish roofline and some issues with the nine-speed transmission's refinement in early models. Declining sedan sales industry-wide and FCA's strategic decision to focus on Jeep SUVs and Ram trucks led to the model's discontinuation after just three years, making it one of the shortest-lived generations in its class. The second-generation 200 represented Chrysler's most competitive mid-size sedan offering but fell victim to changing market preferences and corporate strategy."
